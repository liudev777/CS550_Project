# TODO:

## 02/18:
- Read HReplica and follow sources to learn about data replication.

## 02/25:
- Look into network topology.
- Figure out evaluation metrics.
- Figure out important parameters.
- Figure out application type. (Centralized, decentralized)

## 03/11
- Implement a basic model of data replication system.

## 03/25
- Figured out a simple min cost metric, as well as influencing factors.

## 4/1
- Refine cost metric
- Create a manual action test env

## 4/8 
- look for real datasets (redis)
*rename storage cost to replica storage cost
- internal mapping

stable baselines

## backlog
- Run the model in RL env
